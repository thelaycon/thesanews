        <description>&lt;img src="https://thesanews.com/p/nbbf-leadership-crisis-threats-bans-and-the-decadence-of-basketball-in-nigeria/men-team.jpg" alt="Featured image of post NBBF: Leadership crisis, threats, bans, and the decadence of basketball in Nigeria" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Government of Nigeria has decided to prohibit all basketball activities within the country and all Nigerian basketball teams from competing in international competitions in order to combat the country&amp;rsquo;s sports decadence. Given reports that the Nigeria Basketball Federation&amp;rsquo;s (NBBF) administration is shambolic and lacking in direction, this move is not surprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two leaders and two boards are said to rule the body, with neither side willing to cede control to the other. According to a press release from the Ministry of Youths and Sports Development, the men&amp;rsquo;s national team has vowed to stop playing for Nigeria unless a certain member is removed from the NBBF. Half of the D&amp;rsquo;Tigress players announced their desire to abandon the national team despite qualifying for the Women&amp;rsquo;s Basketball World Cup, confirming the body&amp;rsquo;s leadership turmoil. Despite repeated attempts to alleviate the issue and improve the sport in Nigeria, all efforts have failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the Federal Government&amp;rsquo;s efforts to resolve the leadership situation, the FIBA&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;no politics in football&amp;rdquo; mantra prohibits governments from interfering in basketball activities. The basketball federation proceeded to follow the road of anarchy and instability in the absence of government guidance. A three-year ban on the Nigerian Premier Basketball League imposed by a court ruling added to the pandemonium, as sponsors sought safety by canceling their relationships. As a result, the disappointed government saw no other option except to impose a two-year ban on all basketball activities, which seemed justifiable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The women&amp;rsquo;s team, which had threatened to discontinue playing for Nigeria, published a press statement on May 20, 2022, expressing their unhappiness with the government&amp;rsquo;s decision to prevent them from competing in the Women&amp;rsquo;s Basketball World Cup in Australia. The D&amp;rsquo;Tigress squad highlighted its recent accomplishments in a news statement, including winning the Afrobasket 2021 championship in Cameroon. Despite the team&amp;rsquo;s previous threats to cease playing for the country, its new position, nevertheless, alludes to a possible solution to the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall that in 2010, Nigeria&amp;rsquo;s former president, Goodluck Jonathan, imposed a ban on national football teams participating in international games as a result of a prior humiliating World Cup performance. The ban forced the Nigerian Football Federation to reform, and the men&amp;rsquo;s national side won the AFCON cup against Burkina Faso in 2013. The government&amp;rsquo;s recent prohibition could be another historical occurrence that rhymes. Nonetheless, it is unlikely that the Buhari administration will overturn the decision anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Insecurity: 1635 people kidnapped in Northern Nigeria</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://thesanews.com/p/insecurity-1635-people-kidnapped-in-northern-nigeria/gunmen.png" alt="Featured image of post Insecurity: 1635 people kidnapped in Northern Nigeria" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;From explosions to kidnapping, Nigerians are fast becoming an endangered species in Sub-Saharan Africa. Although, according to HumAngle, N1 trillion was allocated for defense operations in 2022, the country still suffers from proscribed terrorist groups and bandits across the nation. StatiSense, a data company based in Nigeria, gives insight into the geographic demographics of these attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to StatiSense, the North West and North Central are the major geopolitical regions where these crimes were perpetrated. The North accounted for 89.5% (1635) of all kidnappees in Nigeria, a staggering 545:64 ratio compared to the South, which accounted for 192. Surprisingly, the North East, which has been a base for terrorist attacks for the last decade, had only 4.46% of the northern kidnapees, unlike the North West and North Central, which topped the list with 837 and 725 kidnapees, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering the North West, the Abuja-Kaduna railway attack is a symbolic example of the deteriorated state of Kaduna&amp;rsquo;s security. The infamous attack was responsible for the deaths of eight Nigerians and kidnap of 168 passengers. The Abuja-Kaduna motor route bears the same gospel; news and video coverages have depicted the route as one for those as bold as Beauchamp. In addition, Katsina, and Zamfara were also part of the top 3 states with the highest number of kidnapees, all belonging to the North West.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Niger State in the North Central continues to be identified in mainstream media with indiscriminate attacks on already improvished communities. Within the first 17 days of the first quarter, the Governor of the state, Sani Bello, stated that 300 communities had been attacked in Niger States and that 220 people had been killed while 200 were kidnapped, which included 3 Chinese expatriates. Sadly, these are just one of the many attacks that plague the state. Notwithstanding, it was also reported that the two most peaceful states in the country were Nassarawa and Gombe, which both belong to the North Central and North East respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a country which is already known for its notorious corruption and deteriorated sense of morals, the insecurity in the country will mitigate its development and probably deter future investors or expatriates from investing their time and money in a volatile security zone.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Russia: The US propose to manipulate and control African Governments against Russia</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://thesanews.com/p/russia-the-us-propose-to-manipulate-and-control-african-governments-against-russia/usa-russia.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Russia: The US propose to manipulate and control African Governments against Russia" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US has proposed a bill to manipulate or punish African governments and to control the mineral resources of the continent if the Russo-Sino influence on the continent continues to augment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the flying of Russian flags in Ethiopia to the rising numbers of Russo-Sino supporters in Africa, the West appears to be losing its foothold on the continent. Statistics keep pointing to the declining influence of the West in Africa such that; although in 2000, France was the top destination for the importation of goods into Africa; in 2022, over 70% of Africa’s imports are currently sourced from China. In addition, Russia is now Africa’s top source of arms importation and is responsible for 49% of arms exportation to Africa. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict highlights the strategic importance of the continent in the struggle between the East and the West.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ongoing Ukraine-Russian crisis has also revealed the position of many African countries and their citizens concerning the crisis. During the UNGA held for a consensus decision on the Russian-Ukraine conflicts, the decisions of countries, especially in Africa, to abstain from the crisis could have been a source of irritation for the US. In addition, several African citizens, online, have also failed to criticize Russia’s role in the conflict, with many stating the double standards of the west and its corporations concerning the conflicts between Israel and Palestine. This places them on a different moral ground than the USA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the H.R.7311 bill, the USA will seek to control the natural resources, military bases, and security of the continent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.. control strategic sectors in Africa, such as mining and other forms of natural resource extraction and exploitation, military basing and other security cooperation agreements, and information and communications technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could be likened to the undermining of African countries’ freedom of association and self-determination. It seems as though Africa would become a proxy ground for a war for resources between the West and the Eastern. Furthermore, the bill proposes to influence the politics of African countries and manipulate the governments to suit its agenda:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;..manipulate African governments and their policies, as well as the public opinions and voting preferences of African populations and diaspora groups, including those in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the enactment of the bill, annual reports will be made for the next five years on the activities of Russia on the continent, and strategies will be developed to counter activities that do not align with the interests of the US.&lt;/p&gt;
