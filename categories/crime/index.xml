        <description>&lt;img src="https://thesanews.com/p/salvador-ramos-18-kills-his-grandma-and-students-of-former-school-in-a-texas-shooting/shooting.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Salvador Ramos, 18, kills his grandma and students of former school in a Texas shooting" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salvador Ramos, an 18-year-old shooter, went on a shooting rampage in Uvalde, Texas, on Tuesday, May 24, 2022, killing 15 people at Robb Elementary School. The shooter was a former student at the school and was previously accused of murdering his grandmother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assailant, who was reportedly shot by security personnel, entered the primary school and brutally murdered children aged 5 to 11 years old as well as a teacher. A woman has also been reported as being in critical condition and is being treated at the San Antonio University Hospital. The hospital first announced it on social media, saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have received two patients from the shooting at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, one child and one adult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 66-year-old woman&amp;rsquo;s status was upgraded to critical in subsequent updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president of the United States is likely to remark on the topic tonight, according to White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, and has offered his heartfelt condolences to the affected family:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His prayers are with the families impacted by this awful event, and he will speak this evening when he arrives back at the White House.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Texas Governor Greg Abbott praised those who assisted in stopping the shooting spree and expressed Texans&amp;rsquo; outrage over the tragic tragedy. The Texas Division of Emergency Management, according to the Governor, will provide the necessary resources to the relevant officials to help alleviate the effects of the shooting atrocity.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>IPOB: &#39;Nigeria must be politically decentralized&#39; — Adamu Garba boils over Fatima&#39;s death</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://thesanews.com/p/ipob-nigeria-must-be-politically-decentralized-adamu-garba-boils-over-fatimas-death/adamu-garba.jpg" alt="Featured image of post IPOB: &#39;Nigeria must be politically decentralized&#39; — Adamu Garba boils over Fatima&#39;s death" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that Emma Powerful, the spokesman for Nigeria&amp;rsquo;s proscribed terrorist group, the Indigenious People of Biafra (IPOB), has come out to deny the murder of a northerner named Fatima; many political rights activists continue to condemn the incident, citing a perceived double standard in how the country&amp;rsquo;s social justice is administered. Many northerners, like Adamu Garba, an APC ex-member and presidential aspirant, have stated on social media that Nigeria cannot function without appropriate decentralization and power devolution to states and regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fatima, a pregnant mother, was allegedly killed by IPOB terrorists in Anambra state, according to social media reports. The woman is claimed to be a native of Adamawa state and a devout Muslim who lives in Nigeria&amp;rsquo;s South-East political area. This heinous tragedy occurred just a week after a local congressman was assassinated. IPOB and its militant component, the Eastern Security Network, have come under fire for their increasing atrocities against both indigenous and non-indigenous people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adamu Garba took to social media to express his grief at the loss:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the whole world, there’s never been a terrorist organization that is as cowardly as IPOB. More importantly, no one is more prone to self-destruction than their silent supporters. The gruesomely murdered Fatima and her kids are from my state, Adamawa. I mean, are we really in the same country? The double standard is unimaginable. It seems like life in Nigeria has two grades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He went on to point out the hypocrisy of human rights activists on social media, citing the recent jungle justice against a professing Christian in Sokoto for alleged blasphemy against the Islamic religion&amp;rsquo;s prophet. Adamu Garba may have been annoyed by the episode, which got international notice; because according to him, no equivalent response was made to Fatima&amp;rsquo;s death. As a result, Adamu Garba recommended that power be dispersed in order to provide each individual a sense of belonging and security:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The faster we realize that Nigeria needs complete political decentralization and everyone should take care of their regions, the better for us. Why can’t people like Fatima and other people endangered in Anambra come back home since the government won’t protect or even care about them? We should stop pretending or trying to be politically correct. This country is not designed for equality and fairness for all citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insecurity has increased in recent years in the West African country, spurred by religious and political ideologies. Despite the allocation of a trillion naira to combat the threat, insecurity persists in most parts of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Insecurity: 1635 people kidnapped in Northern Nigeria</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://thesanews.com/p/insecurity-1635-people-kidnapped-in-northern-nigeria/gunmen.png" alt="Featured image of post Insecurity: 1635 people kidnapped in Northern Nigeria" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;From explosions to kidnapping, Nigerians are fast becoming an endangered species in Sub-Saharan Africa. Although, according to HumAngle, N1 trillion was allocated for defense operations in 2022, the country still suffers from proscribed terrorist groups and bandits across the nation. StatiSense, a data company based in Nigeria, gives insight into the geographic demographics of these attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to StatiSense, the North West and North Central are the major geopolitical regions where these crimes were perpetrated. The North accounted for 89.5% (1635) of all kidnappees in Nigeria, a staggering 545:64 ratio compared to the South, which accounted for 192. Surprisingly, the North East, which has been a base for terrorist attacks for the last decade, had only 4.46% of the northern kidnapees, unlike the North West and North Central, which topped the list with 837 and 725 kidnapees, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering the North West, the Abuja-Kaduna railway attack is a symbolic example of the deteriorated state of Kaduna&amp;rsquo;s security. The infamous attack was responsible for the deaths of eight Nigerians and kidnap of 168 passengers. The Abuja-Kaduna motor route bears the same gospel; news and video coverages have depicted the route as one for those as bold as Beauchamp. In addition, Katsina, and Zamfara were also part of the top 3 states with the highest number of kidnapees, all belonging to the North West.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Niger State in the North Central continues to be identified in mainstream media with indiscriminate attacks on already improvished communities. Within the first 17 days of the first quarter, the Governor of the state, Sani Bello, stated that 300 communities had been attacked in Niger States and that 220 people had been killed while 200 were kidnapped, which included 3 Chinese expatriates. Sadly, these are just one of the many attacks that plague the state. Notwithstanding, it was also reported that the two most peaceful states in the country were Nassarawa and Gombe, which both belong to the North Central and North East respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a country which is already known for its notorious corruption and deteriorated sense of morals, the insecurity in the country will mitigate its development and probably deter future investors or expatriates from investing their time and money in a volatile security zone.&lt;/p&gt;
