[{"content":"After being asphyxiated by officers at a police parade in Rio de Janeiro, the death of an unarmed black Brazilian named Genivaldo de Jesus Santos has sparked outrage across the country and on social media. The Brazilian man who was suffering from schizophrenia was subjected to police brutality, after being discovered with his health drugs.\nThe victim was pushed down by police officers before being placed into a car, according to a video that has gone viral on the internet. Following that, a white, dense gas was seen rising in the car, with the victim struggling in the vehicle before finally succumbing. The savagery is comparable to the murder of George Flyod, which triggered a global Black Lives Matter protest. The death of Genivaldo de Jesus demonstrates that black people in Brazil may be targets of police abuse.\nIn describing the incident, the cousin of Jesus Santos stated:\n \u0026ldquo;They threw some kind of gas inside the truck and went to the police station, but my uncle was unconscious. He was sent to the hospital, but he did not survive.\u0026rdquo;\n The event occurred on Tuesday in Umbauba, only days after a police operation in the area resulted in the deaths of over 20 individuals in Rio de Janeiro. It has sparked protests in Umbauba, including roadblocks and the nonviolent use of fire to demand justice for the 38-year-old. In response, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said he would contact the police to learn more about what happened and expressed his condolences.\nDespite this, an autopsy indicates that Jesus Santos died of \u0026ldquo;mechanical asphyxia,\u0026rdquo; a type of respiratory failure that matches the victim\u0026rsquo;s nephew\u0026rsquo;s story and the widely circulated recordings.\n","date":"2022-05-29T00:00:00Z","image":"https://thesanews.com/p/a-black-brazilian-was-smoked-to-death-by-the-cops/black-lives_hu88ec75929b9213a6f3ca35dffb3e5d8a_88506_120x120_fill_q75_h2_box_smart1_2.webp","permalink":"https://thesanews.com/p/a-black-brazilian-was-smoked-to-death-by-the-cops/","title":"A black Brazilian was smoked to death by the cops"},{"content":"Despite appearing to have a large number of followers on social media, such that a #1MillionManMarch campaign was created in his favor; Nigerian presidential hopeful, Peter Obi, has abandoned his aspiration to run for one of the country\u0026rsquo;s major political parties, the People\u0026rsquo;s Democratic Party (PDP).\nPDP and APC are the two biggest political parties in the oil-rich country, and they are comparable to the Republican and Democratic parties in the United States in terms of dominance. Winning the presidential primaries of any party, however, requires more than just making memos public. Money and, in most cases, tribal and religious feeling can influence the outcome of primaries in either of the two main parties, as documented in most primary elections.\nA major daily in the country, the Sahara Reporters, has previously claimed that Peter Obi might withdraw from the primaries. According to the source, the presidential aspirant may withdraw from the contest for the PDP presidential ticket due to a low likelihood of winning the party\u0026rsquo;s nomination. They stated that Peter Obi was willing to abandon the party for those who are willing and capable of spending money to obtain delegates\u0026rsquo; votes during the party\u0026rsquo;s primary this weekend.\nJust as the day was coming to a conclusion, People Gazette claimed that Peter Obi had confirmed a gang up against him, effectively ruling him out of the race against the party\u0026rsquo;s other 14 confirmed hopefuls. He is anticipated to reveal the new platform from which he would launch his presidential campaign.\nThe identity of the party, however, has yet to be revealed.\n","date":"2022-05-25T00:00:00Z","image":"https://thesanews.com/p/2023-peter-obi-reveals-a-smear-campaign-against-him-and-withdraws-from-the-partys-ticket-battle/peter-obi_hu22ec84fc683ecdd6f9708a22c9df203b_13060_120x120_fill_q75_h2_box_smart1_2.webp","permalink":"https://thesanews.com/p/2023-peter-obi-reveals-a-smear-campaign-against-him-and-withdraws-from-the-partys-ticket-battle/","title":"2023: Peter Obi reveals a smear campaign against him and withdraws from the party's ticket battle"},{"content":"Salvador Ramos, an 18-year-old shooter, went on a shooting rampage in Uvalde, Texas, on Tuesday, May 24, 2022, killing 15 people at Robb Elementary School. The shooter was a former student at the school and was previously accused of murdering his grandmother.\nThe assailant, who was reportedly shot by security personnel, entered the primary school and brutally murdered children aged 5 to 11 years old as well as a teacher. A woman has also been reported as being in critical condition and is being treated at the San Antonio University Hospital. The hospital first announced it on social media, saying:\n We have received two patients from the shooting at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, one child and one adult.\n The 66-year-old woman\u0026rsquo;s status was upgraded to critical in subsequent updates.\nThe president of the United States is likely to remark on the topic tonight, according to White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, and has offered his heartfelt condolences to the affected family:\n His prayers are with the families impacted by this awful event, and he will speak this evening when he arrives back at the White House.\n Furthermore, Texas Governor Greg Abbott praised those who assisted in stopping the shooting spree and expressed Texans\u0026rsquo; outrage over the tragic tragedy. The Texas Division of Emergency Management, according to the Governor, will provide the necessary resources to the relevant officials to help alleviate the effects of the shooting atrocity.\n","date":"2022-05-25T00:00:00Z","image":"https://thesanews.com/p/salvador-ramos-18-kills-his-grandma-and-students-of-former-school-in-a-texas-shooting/shooting_hu5bbf4513dff991903b8f57494237f123_156168_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://thesanews.com/p/salvador-ramos-18-kills-his-grandma-and-students-of-former-school-in-a-texas-shooting/","title":"Salvador Ramos, 18, kills his grandma and students of former school in a Texas shooting"},{"content":"Despite the fact that Emma Powerful, the spokesman for Nigeria\u0026rsquo;s proscribed terrorist group, the Indigenious People of Biafra (IPOB), has come out to deny the murder of a northerner named Fatima; many political rights activists continue to condemn the incident, citing a perceived double standard in how the country\u0026rsquo;s social justice is administered. Many northerners, like Adamu Garba, an APC ex-member and presidential aspirant, have stated on social media that Nigeria cannot function without appropriate decentralization and power devolution to states and regions.\nFatima, a pregnant mother, was allegedly killed by IPOB terrorists in Anambra state, according to social media reports. The woman is claimed to be a native of Adamawa state and a devout Muslim who lives in Nigeria\u0026rsquo;s South-East political area. This heinous tragedy occurred just a week after a local congressman was assassinated. IPOB and its militant component, the Eastern Security Network, have come under fire for their increasing atrocities against both indigenous and non-indigenous people.\nAdamu Garba took to social media to express his grief at the loss:\n In the whole world, there’s never been a terrorist organization that is as cowardly as IPOB. More importantly, no one is more prone to self-destruction than their silent supporters. The gruesomely murdered Fatima and her kids are from my state, Adamawa. I mean, are we really in the same country? The double standard is unimaginable. It seems like life in Nigeria has two grades.\n He went on to point out the hypocrisy of human rights activists on social media, citing the recent jungle justice against a professing Christian in Sokoto for alleged blasphemy against the Islamic religion\u0026rsquo;s prophet. Adamu Garba may have been annoyed by the episode, which got international notice; because according to him, no equivalent response was made to Fatima\u0026rsquo;s death. As a result, Adamu Garba recommended that power be dispersed in order to provide each individual a sense of belonging and security:\n The faster we realize that Nigeria needs complete political decentralization and everyone should take care of their regions, the better for us. Why can’t people like Fatima and other people endangered in Anambra come back home since the government won’t protect or even care about them? We should stop pretending or trying to be politically correct. This country is not designed for equality and fairness for all citizens.\n Insecurity has increased in recent years in the West African country, spurred by religious and political ideologies. Despite the allocation of a trillion naira to combat the threat, insecurity persists in most parts of the country.\n","date":"2022-05-24T00:00:00Z","image":"https://thesanews.com/p/ipob-nigeria-must-be-politically-decentralized-adamu-garba-boils-over-fatimas-death/adamu-garba_hu006553347f7f252b5cca6a9bf57565c5_4443_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://thesanews.com/p/ipob-nigeria-must-be-politically-decentralized-adamu-garba-boils-over-fatimas-death/","title":"IPOB: 'Nigeria must be politically decentralized' — Adamu Garba boils over Fatima's death"},{"content":"A life-threatening severe shower of rain has hit the KwaZulu-Natal area of South Africa just over a month after a previous disaster. Over 437 people were killed in the last flood, over 13,000 homes were partially or completely demolished, and property worth hundreds of millions of euros was destroyed. Despite the fact that people of KwaZulu-Natal are still attempting to recuperate from their losses, the rain has returned to shatter their life.\nResidents were told over the weekend that rainfall might reach 7.9 inches in some areas. The flood\u0026rsquo;s aftermath devastated roads, rendering them impassable and making escape impossible. In addition, many households have lost power, and many people are lacking in basic necessities like as food and water.\nSeveral authorities expressed their sorrow for individuals who had been displaced by the water. Many people have pointed out that the displaced people have been without drinkable water for days because many water purification centers were destroyed during the flood. Despite this, 82 service centers have been established to meet the needs of the displaced people. In addition, security personnel have been actively involved in assisting the victims in their recovery.\nThe geological setting of KwaZulu-Natal, according to geological research, makes it vulnerable to landslides and flooding. According to some accounts, the recent floods is also linked to global climate change and human impacts on the immediate environment.\n","date":"2022-05-23T00:00:00Z","image":"https://thesanews.com/p/flooding-has-struck-kwazulu-natal-once-more-displacing-dozens-of-people/flooding_hu8edad2f20a253c3d4e812eee3a4ba529_203668_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://thesanews.com/p/flooding-has-struck-kwazulu-natal-once-more-displacing-dozens-of-people/","title":"Flooding has struck KwaZulu-Natal once more, displacing dozens of people"},{"content":"Monkeypox, a non-endemic virus, is spreading across Europe with no known or established link between cases. Currently, over 100 cases have been identified in Germany, Switzerland, Spain, the UK, and other countries across Europe. Although monkeypox has its origins in the tropical jungles of West and Central Africa and is normally spread through intimate contact between humans and infected animals, scientists are baffled by the recent outbreak in Europe. Unrelated infections of people who appear to have no history together in different European countries could point to a mutant or mutation of the virus.\nThe scientific community is familiar with monkeypox as a virus. It is related to the chickenpox virus, which has been wiped out of the world in the last few decades. Monkeypox has a 3% mortality rate despite the availability of vaccinations. Regardless, the latest outbreak, which has been a mystery, could indicate that the virus has changed.\nNormally, an outbreak outside of West and Central Africa would be blamed on someone who recently visited West or Central Africa and came into contact with rodents like the Gambian rats. The new outbreak, however, could not be linked to anything outside of Europe. Indeed, new studies imply that it may have originated in a gay sauna in Madrid.\nEnrinque Ruiz Escudero, Madrid\u0026rsquo;s cabinet minister for health, claimed that the 30 new cases in Spain could be related to a single adult sauna in Madrid. Infected people in the UK were also discovered to be gay. Thus, a certain international festival in Belgium alleges that the three cases discovered in Belgium were imported from contaminated nations, most likely Spain.\nThe United Kingdom, which already has 20 cases, has encouraged gay men to watch for indications of the virus. Given that a gay pride celebration is expected to take place shortly in June, the UK government may be forced to restrict the LGTBQ+ community\u0026rsquo;s activities. This in itself is already causing chaos within the community and beyond.\n","date":"2022-05-21T00:00:00Z","image":"https://thesanews.com/p/monkeypox-the-forthcoming-lgbt-pride-month-may-worsen-the-situation/gay-monkeypox_hu198dd8248b94a6e2f02bef781832c909_344384_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://thesanews.com/p/monkeypox-the-forthcoming-lgbt-pride-month-may-worsen-the-situation/","title":"Monkeypox: The forthcoming LGBT pride month may worsen the situation"},{"content":"The Federal Government of Nigeria has decided to prohibit all basketball activities within the country and all Nigerian basketball teams from competing in international competitions in order to combat the country\u0026rsquo;s sports decadence. Given reports that the Nigeria Basketball Federation\u0026rsquo;s (NBBF) administration is shambolic and lacking in direction, this move is not surprising.\nTwo leaders and two boards are said to rule the body, with neither side willing to cede control to the other. According to a press release from the Ministry of Youths and Sports Development, the men\u0026rsquo;s national team has vowed to stop playing for Nigeria unless a certain member is removed from the NBBF. Half of the D\u0026rsquo;Tigress players announced their desire to abandon the national team despite qualifying for the Women\u0026rsquo;s Basketball World Cup, confirming the body\u0026rsquo;s leadership turmoil. Despite repeated attempts to alleviate the issue and improve the sport in Nigeria, all efforts have failed.\nDespite the Federal Government\u0026rsquo;s efforts to resolve the leadership situation, the FIBA\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;no politics in football\u0026rdquo; mantra prohibits governments from interfering in basketball activities. The basketball federation proceeded to follow the road of anarchy and instability in the absence of government guidance. A three-year ban on the Nigerian Premier Basketball League imposed by a court ruling added to the pandemonium, as sponsors sought safety by canceling their relationships. As a result, the disappointed government saw no other option except to impose a two-year ban on all basketball activities, which seemed justifiable.\nThe women\u0026rsquo;s team, which had threatened to discontinue playing for Nigeria, published a press statement on May 20, 2022, expressing their unhappiness with the government\u0026rsquo;s decision to prevent them from competing in the Women\u0026rsquo;s Basketball World Cup in Australia. The D\u0026rsquo;Tigress squad highlighted its recent accomplishments in a news statement, including winning the Afrobasket 2021 championship in Cameroon. Despite the team\u0026rsquo;s previous threats to cease playing for the country, its new position, nevertheless, alludes to a possible solution to the crisis.\nRecall that in 2010, Nigeria\u0026rsquo;s former president, Goodluck Jonathan, imposed a ban on national football teams participating in international games as a result of a prior humiliating World Cup performance. The ban forced the Nigerian Football Federation to reform, and the men\u0026rsquo;s national side won the AFCON cup against Burkina Faso in 2013. The government\u0026rsquo;s recent prohibition could be another historical occurrence that rhymes. Nonetheless, it is unlikely that the Buhari administration will overturn the decision anytime soon.\n","date":"2022-05-20T00:00:00Z","image":"https://thesanews.com/p/nbbf-leadership-crisis-threats-bans-and-the-decadence-of-basketball-in-nigeria/men-team_hu07a34386e124657a7b070d980b1aba17_88647_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://thesanews.com/p/nbbf-leadership-crisis-threats-bans-and-the-decadence-of-basketball-in-nigeria/","title":"NBBF: Leadership crisis, threats, bans, and the decadence of basketball in Nigeria"},{"content":"From explosions to kidnapping, Nigerians are fast becoming an endangered species in Sub-Saharan Africa. Although, according to HumAngle, N1 trillion was allocated for defense operations in 2022, the country still suffers from proscribed terrorist groups and bandits across the nation. StatiSense, a data company based in Nigeria, gives insight into the geographic demographics of these attacks.\nAccording to StatiSense, the North West and North Central are the major geopolitical regions where these crimes were perpetrated. The North accounted for 89.5% (1635) of all kidnappees in Nigeria, a staggering 545:64 ratio compared to the South, which accounted for 192. Surprisingly, the North East, which has been a base for terrorist attacks for the last decade, had only 4.46% of the northern kidnapees, unlike the North West and North Central, which topped the list with 837 and 725 kidnapees, respectively.\nConsidering the North West, the Abuja-Kaduna railway attack is a symbolic example of the deteriorated state of Kaduna\u0026rsquo;s security. The infamous attack was responsible for the deaths of eight Nigerians and kidnap of 168 passengers. The Abuja-Kaduna motor route bears the same gospel; news and video coverages have depicted the route as one for those as bold as Beauchamp. In addition, Katsina, and Zamfara were also part of the top 3 states with the highest number of kidnapees, all belonging to the North West.\nSimilarly, Niger State in the North Central continues to be identified in mainstream media with indiscriminate attacks on already improvished communities. Within the first 17 days of the first quarter, the Governor of the state, Sani Bello, stated that 300 communities had been attacked in Niger States and that 220 people had been killed while 200 were kidnapped, which included 3 Chinese expatriates. Sadly, these are just one of the many attacks that plague the state. Notwithstanding, it was also reported that the two most peaceful states in the country were Nassarawa and Gombe, which both belong to the North Central and North East respectively.\nAs a country which is already known for its notorious corruption and deteriorated sense of morals, the insecurity in the country will mitigate its development and probably deter future investors or expatriates from investing their time and money in a volatile security zone.\n","date":"2022-05-19T00:00:00Z","image":"https://thesanews.com/p/insecurity-1635-people-kidnapped-in-northern-nigeria/gunmen_huc5c4da5e04794b099ef6c64dd8d314ad_2568540_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://thesanews.com/p/insecurity-1635-people-kidnapped-in-northern-nigeria/","title":"Insecurity: 1635 people kidnapped in Northern Nigeria"},{"content":"The US has proposed a bill to manipulate or punish African governments and to control the mineral resources of the continent if the Russo-Sino influence on the continent continues to augment.\nFrom the flying of Russian flags in Ethiopia to the rising numbers of Russo-Sino supporters in Africa, the West appears to be losing its foothold on the continent. Statistics keep pointing to the declining influence of the West in Africa such that; although in 2000, France was the top destination for the importation of goods into Africa; in 2022, over 70% of Africa’s imports are currently sourced from China. In addition, Russia is now Africa’s top source of arms importation and is responsible for 49% of arms exportation to Africa. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict highlights the strategic importance of the continent in the struggle between the East and the West.\nThe ongoing Ukraine-Russian crisis has also revealed the position of many African countries and their citizens concerning the crisis. During the UNGA held for a consensus decision on the Russian-Ukraine conflicts, the decisions of countries, especially in Africa, to abstain from the crisis could have been a source of irritation for the US. In addition, several African citizens, online, have also failed to criticize Russia’s role in the conflict, with many stating the double standards of the west and its corporations concerning the conflicts between Israel and Palestine. This places them on a different moral ground than the USA.\nAccording to the H.R.7311 bill, the USA will seek to control the natural resources, military bases, and security of the continent:\n .. control strategic sectors in Africa, such as mining and other forms of natural resource extraction and exploitation, military basing and other security cooperation agreements, and information and communications technology.\n This could be likened to the undermining of African countries’ freedom of association and self-determination. It seems as though Africa would become a proxy ground for a war for resources between the West and the Eastern. Furthermore, the bill proposes to influence the politics of African countries and manipulate the governments to suit its agenda:\n ..manipulate African governments and their policies, as well as the public opinions and voting preferences of African populations and diaspora groups, including those in the United States.\n After the enactment of the bill, annual reports will be made for the next five years on the activities of Russia on the continent, and strategies will be developed to counter activities that do not align with the interests of the US.\n","date":"2022-05-17T00:00:00Z","image":"https://thesanews.com/p/russia-the-us-propose-to-manipulate-and-control-african-governments-against-russia/usa-russia_hucfe448d08a54253b1ae70d606a7d8be8_15300_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://thesanews.com/p/russia-the-us-propose-to-manipulate-and-control-african-governments-against-russia/","title":"Russia: The US propose to manipulate and control African Governments against Russia"}]
