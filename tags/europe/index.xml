        <description>&lt;img src="https://thesanews.com/p/monkeypox-the-forthcoming-lgbt-pride-month-may-worsen-the-situation/gay-monkeypox.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Monkeypox: The forthcoming LGBT pride month may worsen the situation" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monkeypox, a non-endemic virus, is spreading across Europe with no known or established link between cases. Currently, over 100 cases have been identified in Germany, Switzerland, Spain, the UK, and other countries across Europe. Although monkeypox has its origins in the tropical jungles of West and Central Africa and is normally spread through intimate contact between humans and infected animals, scientists are baffled by the recent outbreak in Europe. Unrelated infections of people who appear to have no history together in different European countries could point to a mutant or mutation of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientific community is familiar with monkeypox as a virus. It is related to the chickenpox virus, which has been wiped out of the world in the last few decades. Monkeypox has a 3% mortality rate despite the availability of vaccinations. Regardless, the latest outbreak, which has been a mystery, could indicate that the virus has changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, an outbreak outside of West and Central Africa would be blamed on someone who recently visited West or Central Africa and came into contact with rodents like the Gambian rats. The new outbreak, however, could not be linked to anything outside of Europe. Indeed, new studies imply that it may have originated in a gay sauna in Madrid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enrinque Ruiz Escudero, Madrid&amp;rsquo;s cabinet minister for health, claimed that the 30 new cases in Spain could be related to a single adult sauna in Madrid. Infected people in the UK were also discovered to be gay. Thus, a certain international festival in Belgium alleges that the three cases discovered in Belgium were imported from contaminated nations, most likely Spain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United Kingdom, which already has 20 cases, has encouraged gay men to watch for indications of the virus. Given that a gay pride celebration is expected to take place shortly in June, the UK government may be forced to restrict the LGTBQ+ community&amp;rsquo;s activities. This in itself is already causing chaos within the community and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
