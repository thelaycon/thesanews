        <description>&lt;img src="https://thesanews.com/p/russia-the-us-propose-to-manipulate-and-control-african-governments-against-russia/usa-russia.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Russia: The US propose to manipulate and control African Governments against Russia" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US has proposed a bill to manipulate or punish African governments and to control the mineral resources of the continent if the Russo-Sino influence on the continent continues to augment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the flying of Russian flags in Ethiopia to the rising numbers of Russo-Sino supporters in Africa, the West appears to be losing its foothold on the continent. Statistics keep pointing to the declining influence of the West in Africa such that; although in 2000, France was the top destination for the importation of goods into Africa; in 2022, over 70% of Africa’s imports are currently sourced from China. In addition, Russia is now Africa’s top source of arms importation and is responsible for 49% of arms exportation to Africa. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict highlights the strategic importance of the continent in the struggle between the East and the West.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ongoing Ukraine-Russian crisis has also revealed the position of many African countries and their citizens concerning the crisis. During the UNGA held for a consensus decision on the Russian-Ukraine conflicts, the decisions of countries, especially in Africa, to abstain from the crisis could have been a source of irritation for the US. In addition, several African citizens, online, have also failed to criticize Russia’s role in the conflict, with many stating the double standards of the west and its corporations concerning the conflicts between Israel and Palestine. This places them on a different moral ground than the USA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the H.R.7311 bill, the USA will seek to control the natural resources, military bases, and security of the continent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.. control strategic sectors in Africa, such as mining and other forms of natural resource extraction and exploitation, military basing and other security cooperation agreements, and information and communications technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could be likened to the undermining of African countries’ freedom of association and self-determination. It seems as though Africa would become a proxy ground for a war for resources between the West and the Eastern. Furthermore, the bill proposes to influence the politics of African countries and manipulate the governments to suit its agenda:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;..manipulate African governments and their policies, as well as the public opinions and voting preferences of African populations and diaspora groups, including those in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the enactment of the bill, annual reports will be made for the next five years on the activities of Russia on the continent, and strategies will be developed to counter activities that do not align with the interests of the US.&lt;/p&gt;
