        <description>&lt;img src="https://thesanews.com/p/nbbf-leadership-crisis-threats-bans-and-the-decadence-of-basketball-in-nigeria/men-team.jpg" alt="Featured image of post NBBF: Leadership crisis, threats, bans, and the decadence of basketball in Nigeria" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Government of Nigeria has decided to prohibit all basketball activities within the country and all Nigerian basketball teams from competing in international competitions in order to combat the country&amp;rsquo;s sports decadence. Given reports that the Nigeria Basketball Federation&amp;rsquo;s (NBBF) administration is shambolic and lacking in direction, this move is not surprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two leaders and two boards are said to rule the body, with neither side willing to cede control to the other. According to a press release from the Ministry of Youths and Sports Development, the men&amp;rsquo;s national team has vowed to stop playing for Nigeria unless a certain member is removed from the NBBF. Half of the D&amp;rsquo;Tigress players announced their desire to abandon the national team despite qualifying for the Women&amp;rsquo;s Basketball World Cup, confirming the body&amp;rsquo;s leadership turmoil. Despite repeated attempts to alleviate the issue and improve the sport in Nigeria, all efforts have failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the Federal Government&amp;rsquo;s efforts to resolve the leadership situation, the FIBA&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;no politics in football&amp;rdquo; mantra prohibits governments from interfering in basketball activities. The basketball federation proceeded to follow the road of anarchy and instability in the absence of government guidance. A three-year ban on the Nigerian Premier Basketball League imposed by a court ruling added to the pandemonium, as sponsors sought safety by canceling their relationships. As a result, the disappointed government saw no other option except to impose a two-year ban on all basketball activities, which seemed justifiable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The women&amp;rsquo;s team, which had threatened to discontinue playing for Nigeria, published a press statement on May 20, 2022, expressing their unhappiness with the government&amp;rsquo;s decision to prevent them from competing in the Women&amp;rsquo;s Basketball World Cup in Australia. The D&amp;rsquo;Tigress squad highlighted its recent accomplishments in a news statement, including winning the Afrobasket 2021 championship in Cameroon. Despite the team&amp;rsquo;s previous threats to cease playing for the country, its new position, nevertheless, alludes to a possible solution to the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall that in 2010, Nigeria&amp;rsquo;s former president, Goodluck Jonathan, imposed a ban on national football teams participating in international games as a result of a prior humiliating World Cup performance. The ban forced the Nigerian Football Federation to reform, and the men&amp;rsquo;s national side won the AFCON cup against Burkina Faso in 2013. The government&amp;rsquo;s recent prohibition could be another historical occurrence that rhymes. Nonetheless, it is unlikely that the Buhari administration will overturn the decision anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
